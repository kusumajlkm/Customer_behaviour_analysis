# Customer_behaviour_analysis
#data analytics project showing customer behaviour using postgre sql, powerbi,python


## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, from raw data ingestion to actionable insights and visualization. It showcases practical skills in Python, SQL, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), business intelligence, and reporting—designed to be **recruiter-friendly and easy to understand**.

The goal of the project is to analyze a dataset, extract meaningful insights, and present them through an interactive **Power BI dashboard** and a concise **PPT report**.
